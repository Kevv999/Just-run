## Just run it

In this course we will create an app for running! You will be able to see you logged kilometers 
and durations in nice grafs.

##  Features 
View your runs, and list the past runs you've completed. 
Previous runs are complemented with graphs for statistics and map to view the route.
Start a new run where you record duration, gps tracking, speed, distance and height climbed.
Edit settings to get more exact results for calories and to view it in your prefered unit.
